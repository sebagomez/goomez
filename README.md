Goomez Search
=============

Goomez search is a [Lucene.Net](http://lucenenet.apache.org/) client that indexes the available software in our office. It'll index the extensions and locations stated in the GoomezCrawler.xml file.

It also has a web client for resolving queries to the index, it's a very Google-like web interface. I actually inspected the css properties from Google.com

It's been recently migrated to .NET Core 2.0 and the web client is an [ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/) 2.0 app with [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/).
